# Scala Programming Course

This repository contains code examples and exercises from a Scala programming course. The project is structured to provide both lecture examples and hands-on exercises for learning Scala.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main packages:

### `lectures` Package
Contains executable Scala files that demonstrate concepts covered in the course videos. Each file corresponds to specific lecture topics and can be run independently.

### `exercises` Package
Contains practical exercises designed to reinforce the concepts learned in the lectures. These are standalone executable files that allow you to practice Scala programming.

## Running the Code

Each file in both the `lectures` and `exercises` packages is independently executable. You can run any file directly to see the concepts in action.
